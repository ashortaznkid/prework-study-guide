## Description

For coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota to help evaluate my coding skills. Most of what was coded for the assignment was a refresher for myself and a great exercise to get in the mindset of coding again.

## Usage

This study guide could be used in many helpful ways throughout the course of the boot camp. One of which is to easily take notes of the class while also intergrating programing techniques at the same time. On the other hand it can be used as an assestment for my professors to ensure that I grasp concepts taught during class and can practiacally use them first hand. Lastly, this study guide could be used as an exellant showcase of skill towards job interviews and resumes for any future aspiratons.
